## Hello and welcome to my GitHub!

I'm Abby, a third-year honors student at Boston University majoring in Data Science üíª and Comparative Literature üåé, with a concentration in Spanish. I'm currently based out of Boston, Massachusetts, but love to travel and learn new languages. In my free time I love to lift weights, run, and hang out with my Wheaten Terrier Teddy üêæ.
